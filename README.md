The Zeta Programming Language
=============================

This is an implementation of a Virtual Machine (VM) for the zeta programming
language I'm working on in my spare time. Zeta draws inspiration from LISP,
Smalltalk, ML, JavaScript and C. The language is currently at the early
prototype stage, meaning the syntax and semantics are likely to change a lot
in the coming months. At the moment, this platform and language is mostly of
interest to tinkerers and those with a special interest in compilers or
language design.

## Quickstart

Requirements:

- A C compiler

- GNU make

- A POSIX compliant OS (Linux or Mac OS)

To built the zeta VM, go to the source directory and run `make`

Tests can then be run using the test command: `./zeta --test`

## Language Design

Planned features of the zeta programming language include:

- Dynamic typing

- Dynamically extensible objects, as in JavaScript

- Garbage collection

- A user-extensible grammar, giving programmers the ability to define new syntactic constructs

- No distinction between statements and expression, everything is an expression, as in LISP

- Functional constructs such as map and foreach

- A module system

- An easy to use canvas library to render simple 2D graphics

## Zeta VM

I've chosen to implement the VM core in pure C, for the following reasons:

- To make low-level details explicit (for instance, the layout of hosted objects in memory)

- To avoid hidden sources of overhead

- To avoid dependence on non-portable tools and languages. GCC is available on almost every platform in existence

The zeta implementation will be largely [self-hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting).
The core VM will implement an interpreter in C, but the garbage collector and zeta JIT
compiler will be written in the zeta language itself.

A custom x86 assembler and backend will be built for the JIT compiler, as was done for the [Higgs](https://github.com/higgsjs/Higgs) VM. This will allow self-modifying code to be generated by the JIT. The x86 backend will be implemented in the zeta language as well.
